# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday November 29 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Created navbar and title section for Product Landing Page project using Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I have been following tutorials on my Udemy course for a while and it was only when I started working on my own project that I realised how hard it was to retain so much of the info. I'm using Bootstrap and I'm making a lot of use of the documentation and trial and error.

### Day 2: Monday November 30 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Created features section and used Bootstrip grid for responsive layout.

**Thoughts:** I had also intended to create the third section today but I hit a brick wall trying to embed a Youtube video. Also not really sure how to use Github!

### Day 3: Tuesday December 1 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I added a form section and a video, transferred it into Codepen and started running the FCC tests to fix a few problems.

**Thoughts:** I managed to get the video to appear right away this time by taking it out of the section tags. I'm not sure why it happened but it seemed to do the trick.

### Day 4: Wednesday December 2 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Tindog project on Angela Yu's web development course and learned more about media queries.

**Thoughts:** I definitely learn more by doing and I need to be careful when following video courses and tutorials that I take breaks regularly to actually try out the code myself instead of just passively consuming the course.
