# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday November 29 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Created navbar and title section for Product Landing Page project using Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I have been following tutorials on my Udemy course for a while and it was only when I started working on my own project that I realised how hard it was to retain so much of the info. I'm using Bootstrap and I'm making a lot of use of the documentation and trial and error.

### Day 2: Monday November 30 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Created features section and used Bootstrip grid for responsive layout.

**Thoughts:** I had also intended to create the third section today but I hit a brick wall trying to embed a Youtube video. Also not really sure how to use Github!
