# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sunday November 29 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created navbar and title section for Product Landing Page project using Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I have been following tutorials on my Udemy course for a while and it was only when I started working on my own project that I realised how hard it was to retain so much of the info. I'm using Bootstrap and I'm making a lot of use of the documentation and trial and error.
